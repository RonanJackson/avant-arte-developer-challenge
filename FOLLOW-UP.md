# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?

I would have added a proper testing library such as react-testing-library. I'm not well versed in frontend testing, so this is very new to me. Backend testing is much easier :D

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?

I managed to get the UI to look almost identical to the expected design. I haven't done UI in a long time. And any UI I do ends up being using a library that comes with pre built components that are easy to style and move around. An example of this is a previous takehome assignment: https://github.com/RonanJackson/fullstack-dev-challenge

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?

I mainly spend time doing backend at Skyscanner and haven't touched frontend in a good while. I want to get back into it a lot more, so figuring out how to get the flex wrap cards to behave as I wanted took some time. It looks ok in the desired specifications, but looks terrible on a larger screen!

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.

I liked this test! It challenged me quite a lot more than others due to the frontend heavy aspect without any styling libraries. As mentioned before, I don't get to do UI much in my day job so this was fun to try and get working... I hope it was a good enough effort.

### Q) Question for Avant Arte

- I found it odd that this project uses backpack-react-scripts which comes from Skyscanner, any particular reason for doing so?
- It would have been nice to attach a backend properly so I could flex a bit more there (as the role is full stack, not frontend only). I have linked a previous takehome assignment above which you can use as an indicator.

P.S. there are some typos in the README:
'sollution'
